## 1. Introduction (1 minute)
1. Hello, I'm [Your Name]. I'm a hands-on software engineer with extensive experience in data platforms and distributed systems.
2. I'm interested in the Principal Software Engineer, Data Platform position at SoFi.
3. Instead of a traditional application, I've built a functional demo that showcases both my technical skills and my understanding of SoFi's data-driven approach.
4. I've created an Experimentation Platform that addresses a critical challenge in financial services: making data-driven decisions quickly and confidently.
5. This platform enables rapid testing and validation of new features, allowing teams to measure the impact of changes before full deployment.
6. In a financial services environment like SoFi, where user trust is paramount, this approach minimizes risk while maximizing innovation velocity.
7. The platform demonstrates how modern data architecture can transform decision-making processes by providing clear, actionable insights based on real user behavior.
8. I completed this end-to-end implementation in just one day, demonstrating my ability to rapidly deliver value while maintaining high engineering standards.

## 2. Technical Architecture & Implementation (1.5 minutes)
1. Overview
   1. The platform follows a modern, cloud-native architecture built on AWS services
   2. The frontend is a React application with TypeScript for type safety
   3. The backend uses serverless Lambda functions with Express for the API
   4. Data is stored in DynamoDB with optimized schema design for experimentation data
   5. Report generation is handled by AWS Batch using a Java-based statistical analysis engine
   6. Reports are stored in S3 and made available through the API
   7. The entire infrastructure is defined as code using AWS CDK
   8. Everything is organized in an NX monorepo for better code sharing and build optimization

2. Data Flow
   1. Experiments are created through the web interface and stored in DynamoDB
   2. Users are assigned to experiment variants using a consistent hashing algorithm
   3. User interactions are captured as events and stored in DynamoDB
   4. Reports are generated asynchronously using AWS Batch
   5. Statistical analysis is performed to determine experiment outcomes
   6. Results are visualized in the web interface with confidence intervals

3. Key Technical Decisions
   1. Implemented a single-table design in DynamoDB for efficient querying
   2. Used AWS Batch for computationally intensive statistical analysis
   3. Leveraged TypeScript interfaces shared between frontend and backend
   4. Implemented comprehensive validation, logging, and error handling
   5. Followed 12-Factor App principles for cloud-native deployment
   6. Used environment variables for configuration, following security best practices

## 3. User Experience & Business Impact (1 minute)
1. Let me show you the application from a user's perspective:
   1. Clean, intuitive dashboard for experiment management
   2. Simple interface for creating new experiments with multiple variants
   3. Sample page demonstrating experiments in action
   4. Comprehensive reporting with statistical significance testing
   5. Real-time event tracking for immediate feedback

2. This platform delivers significant business value:
   1. Reduces time-to-market for new features by enabling rapid testing
   2. Minimizes risk by validating changes with a subset of users first
   3. Provides data-driven insights to inform product decisions
   4. Enables more frequent and systematic testing of ideas
   5. Creates a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement

3. For SoFi specifically, this approach could:
   1. Test different loan application flows to optimize conversion
   2. Validate new financial product offerings with targeted user segments
   3. Optimize user engagement with personalized experiences
   4. Measure the impact of UI/UX changes on key metrics
   5. Provide quantifiable ROI for product development efforts

## 4. Real-time Analytics Demo (1.5 minutes)
1. Creating an experiment
   1. Define experiment parameters (name, description, target percentage)
   2. Create variants (e.g., different button colors or messaging)
   3. Activate the experiment

2. Viewing the experiment in action
   1. Navigate to the sample page
   2. See different variants based on user/session ID
   3. Interact with the page to generate events

3. Generating and analyzing reports
   1. Trigger report generation for an experiment
   2. View the report with statistical analysis
   3. Interpret the results and make data-driven decisions
   4. Demonstrate how this informs the product development cycle

## 5. Conclusion & Why I'm a fit for SoFi (1 minute)
1. This project demonstrates my ability to deliver value in several ways relevant to SoFi:
   1. Building scalable data platforms that enable data-driven decision making
   2. Implementing cloud-native solutions using modern AWS services
   3. Creating end-to-end systems that connect data collection, processing, and visualization
   4. Applying statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from raw data
   5. Delivering high-quality code with proper testing, validation, and error handling

2. I'm particularly excited about SoFi for several reasons:
   1. The opportunity to work on data platforms that power financial innovation
   2. The chance to contribute to SoFi's data-driven culture and decision-making processes
   3. The technical challenges of building scalable systems in a regulated industry
   4. The potential to impact millions of users through better financial products

3. My experience aligns perfectly with SoFi's needs:
   1. Extensive experience with distributed systems and data platforms
   2. Proven track record of building scalable, production-ready solutions
   3. Strong background in both frontend and backend development
   4. Experience with the modern data stack including Snowflake, Airflow, and dbt
   5. Passion for using data to drive business outcomes

4. Thank you for your consideration. I'm excited about the possibility of joining SoFi's data platform team and contributing to your mission of helping people achieve financial independence.
