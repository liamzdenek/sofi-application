## 1. Introduction (1 minute)
1. Hello Eric and Jeremy, I'm Liam. I'm a hands-on SWE with extensive experience in data platforms and distributed systems.
2. I'm interested in working in Engineering at SoFi.
3. Instead of a traditional application, I've built a functional demo that showcases both my technical skills and my understanding of SoFi's data-driven culture.
4. I've created an Experimentation Platform from scratch that addresses a critical challenge in financial services: making data-driven decisions quickly and confidently.
5. In a financial services environment like SoFi, where user trust is paramount, this platform allows teams to measure the impact of changes before full deployment. maximizing innovation velocity and minimizing risk.
6. I completed this project in just one day, demonstrating my ability to rapidly deliver value while maintaining high engineering standards.

## 2. User Experience & Business Impact (1.5 minutes)
1. Viewing a pre-configured experiment
2. Generating data for that experiment
3. Reporting the experiment results

## 3. Reporting Analytics Demo (1 minutes)
1. Try it out CTA

## 4. Technical Architecture & Implementation (1.5 minutes) 
1. Front end. React/Vite, S3, Cloudfront
2. Back end. Lambda. API Gateway
3. Persistence. DynamoDB for storing configured experiments
4. Report. Java, AWS Batch.
5. CDK

6. I focused on building a production-ready, highly scalable solution that demonstrates a balance of technical excellence and practical business value, which I believe is what SoFi is looking for in its Engineers.

## 5. Conclusion & Why I'm a fit for SoFi (1 minute)
1. Why I'm a fit for SoFi
   1. I demonstrated a focus on real business problems that are relevant to SoFi.
   2. I demonstrated expertise in data collection, processing, and visualization
   3. I demonstrated my ability to rapidly deliver within a tight timeframe
   4. I believe I've demonstrated that I wouldn't simply meet the bar at SoFi, I will raise it.

2. I'm particularly excited about SoFi for several reasons:
   1. The chance to contribute to SoFi's data-driven culture and your decision-making processes
   2. The impact of building systems that real people use to make their lives better
   3. Finally, I believe I can accomplish my major learning goal at SoFi while delivering exceptional impact. (improve my product oriented-thinking)

3. I'm excited about the possibility of joining SoFi and contributing to your mission of helping people achieve financial independence.
4. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing back
