# Progress: Experimentation Platform Accelerator

## What Works

We have completed:

- ✅ Project concept definition
- ✅ Architecture planning
- ✅ Technical stack selection
- ✅ API contract definition
- ✅ Memory bank documentation
- ✅ Detailed TypeScript interfaces for all API contracts
- ✅ Initialize NX monorepo
- ✅ Create `packages` directory for all monorepo packages
- ✅ Generate necessary projects within the packages directory
- ✅ Set up basic project structure

The following projects have been created:
- ✅ Web application (React): packages/web
- ✅ API application (Express): packages/api
- ✅ Shared library: packages/shared
- ✅ Experiment API library: packages/experiment-api
- ✅ UI Components library: packages/ui-components
- ✅ Infrastructure (CDK): packages/infrastructure

## What's Left to Build

Implementation of the core functionality:

1. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - [ ] Implement experiment setup UI in the web application
   - [ ] Develop sample page for demonstrating experiments
   - [ ] Build report viewing interface
   - [ ] Implement UI components in the ui-components library

2. **Backend Implementation**:
   - [ ] Implement API endpoints in the Express application
   - [ ] Create data models in the shared library
   - [ ] Implement API client in the experiment-api library
   - [ ] Develop AWS Batch report generation job in Java

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - [✅] Create basic CDK project structure
   - [ ] Complete CDK stack for deploying the application
   - [ ] Configure AWS resources (DynamoDB, S3, AWS Batch)
   - [ ] Set up environment variables

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - [ ] Test end-to-end workflow
   - [ ] Refine implementation based on testing
   - [ ] Prepare final demonstration

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Project Setup Complete, Ready for Implementation
**Completion Percentage**: ~30%
**Next Milestone**: Core Implementation

We have completed the initial planning, architecture, and project setup phases. The NX monorepo has been initialized with all the necessary projects and libraries. We are now ready to begin implementing the core functionality of the Experimentation Platform Accelerator.

## Known Issues

Now that we've set up the project structure, we've encountered a few issues:

1. **Project Structure**: We initially had issues with NX generators creating nested directories (e.g., packages/shared/shared instead of packages/shared). This has been fixed by regenerating the libraries with the correct directory structure.

2. **E2E Testing**: We had to disable E2E testing as it wasn't supported on the system. We removed the api-e2e directory that was generated.

3. **Configuration Paths**: We had to fix paths in configuration files (jest.config.ts and eslint.config.js) to properly reference the root configuration files.

4. **Package Lock**: We encountered issues with the package-lock.json file and had to delete it.

Potential challenges for the implementation phase:

1. **Time Constraint**: The one-day timeframe is ambitious for implementing all components. We may need to further simplify certain aspects as we progress.

2. **Local Development**: Setting up local development for AWS services can be challenging. We may need to use mocks or simplified local alternatives for some components.

3. **TypeScript/Java Integration**: Ensuring consistent data structures between TypeScript and Java components will require careful planning.

4. **AWS Batch Configuration**: Setting up AWS Batch for the report generation job may be complex and time-consuming.

5. **Environment Variable Management**: Managing environment variables across different components and build processes will require careful configuration.

These issues and challenges will be monitored and addressed as we move into the implementation phase.

## Lessons Learned

As we progress through the project, we will document lessons learned here to inform future work.
