# Progress: Experimentation Platform Accelerator

## What Works

We have completed:

- ✅ Project concept definition
- ✅ Architecture planning
- ✅ Technical stack selection
- ✅ API contract definition
- ✅ Memory bank documentation
- ✅ Detailed TypeScript interfaces for all API contracts
- ✅ Initialize NX monorepo
- ✅ Create `packages` directory for all monorepo packages
- ✅ Generate necessary projects within the packages directory
- ✅ Set up basic project structure
- ✅ Implement shared types in the shared library
- ✅ Implement API client in the shared library (moved from experiment-api)
- ✅ Implement backend API services for experiments, events, and reports
- ✅ Set up environment variables for local development and AWS deployment
- ✅ Implement comprehensive logging and error handling in the API
- ✅ Create shared UI components in the ui-components library
- ✅ Implement frontend with TanStack Router
- ✅ Create pages for experiments, reports, and sample checkout
- ✅ Implement button color experiment on sample checkout page
- ✅ Implement comprehensive logging and error handling in the API
- ✅ Create shared UI components for experimentation in the ui-components library
- ✅ Set up environment variable configuration for the experimentation API URL

The following projects have been created:
- ✅ Web application (React): packages/web
- ✅ API application (Express): packages/api
- ✅ Shared library: packages/shared
- ✅ Experiment API library: packages/experiment-api
- ✅ UI Components library: packages/ui-components
- ✅ Infrastructure (CDK): packages/infrastructure

## What's Left to Build

Implementation of the core functionality:

1. **Backend Implementation**:
   - [ ] Test the API endpoints
   - [✅] Implement error handling and validation
   - [✅] Set up logging

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - [✅] Implement experiment setup UI in the web application
   - [✅] Develop sample page for demonstrating experiments
   - [✅] Build report viewing interface
   - [✅] Implement shared UI components in the ui-components library

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - [✅] Create basic CDK project structure
   - [ ] Complete CDK stack for deploying the application
   - [ ] Configure AWS resources (DynamoDB, S3, AWS Batch)
   - [✅] Set up environment variables for local development

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - [✅] Test frontend-backend integration
   - [ ] Test end-to-end workflow with AWS services
   - [ ] Refine implementation based on testing
   - [ ] Prepare final demonstration

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Testing and Deployment
**Completion Percentage**: ~85%
**Next Milestone**: AWS Deployment

We have completed the initial planning, architecture, and project setup phases. The NX monorepo has been initialized with all the necessary projects and libraries. We have implemented the shared types, API client, and backend API services with proper error handling and logging. We have also implemented shared UI components for experimentation in the ui-components library and built the frontend application with TanStack Router. The application now has pages for managing experiments, viewing reports, and a sample checkout page that demonstrates a button color experiment. We are now ready to deploy the application to AWS and test the end-to-end workflow.

## Known Issues

Now that we've set up the project structure, we've encountered a few issues:

1. **Project Structure**: We initially had issues with NX generators creating nested directories (e.g., packages/shared/shared instead of packages/shared). This has been fixed by regenerating the libraries with the correct directory structure.

2. **E2E Testing**: We had to disable E2E testing as it wasn't supported on the system. We removed the api-e2e directory that was generated.

3. **Configuration Paths**: We had to fix paths in configuration files (jest.config.ts and eslint.config.js) to properly reference the root configuration files.

4. **Package Lock**: We encountered issues with the package-lock.json file and had to delete it.

Potential challenges for the implementation phase:

1. **Time Constraint**: The one-day timeframe is ambitious for implementing all components. We may need to further simplify certain aspects as we progress.

2. **AWS Integration**: Setting up and testing AWS services can be challenging. We need to ensure proper configuration and error handling.

3. **TypeScript/Java Integration**: Ensuring consistent data structures between TypeScript and Java components will require careful planning.

4. **AWS Batch Configuration**: Setting up AWS Batch for the report generation job may be complex and time-consuming.

5. **Environment Variable Management**: Managing environment variables across different components and build processes will require careful configuration.

These issues and challenges will be monitored and addressed as we move into the implementation phase.

## Lessons Learned

As we progress through the project, we will document lessons learned here to inform future work.

1. **NX Monorepo Structure**: The NX monorepo structure provides a clean separation of concerns while enabling code sharing. However, it requires careful configuration to avoid nested directories and ensure proper references between projects.

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Sharing TypeScript interfaces between frontend and backend ensures type safety and consistency. This approach helps catch errors early in the development process.

3. **AWS Integration**: AWS services provide powerful capabilities for building cloud-native applications. However, they require careful configuration and error handling to ensure reliable operation.
