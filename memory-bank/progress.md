# Progress: SoFi Application Project

## What Works

As we are in the initial planning phase, we have completed:

- ✅ Project concept definition
- ✅ Architecture planning
- ✅ Technical stack selection
- ✅ API contract definition
- ✅ Memory bank documentation

## What's Left to Build

The entire implementation is still pending:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - [ ] Initialize NX monorepo
   - [ ] Generate necessary projects
   - [ ] Set up basic project structure

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - [ ] Create React application structure
   - [ ] Implement experiment setup UI
   - [ ] Develop sample page for demonstrating experiments
   - [ ] Build report viewing interface

3. **Backend Implementation**:
   - [ ] Create Lambda functions for API endpoints
   - [ ] Implement DynamoDB interactions
   - [ ] Develop AWS Batch report generation job in Java

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - [ ] Create CDK stack for deploying the application
   - [ ] Configure AWS resources and permissions
   - [ ] Set up environment variables

5. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - [ ] Test end-to-end workflow
   - [ ] Refine implementation based on testing
   - [ ] Prepare final demonstration

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Planning and Architecture
**Completion Percentage**: ~10%
**Next Milestone**: NX Monorepo Setup

We have completed the initial planning and architecture phase and are ready to begin implementation. The memory bank documentation provides a solid foundation for the project, with clear guidelines on architecture, technical decisions, and implementation rules.

## Known Issues

As we are in the planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, we have identified potential challenges:

1. **Time Constraint**: The one-day timeframe is ambitious for implementing all components. We may need to further simplify certain aspects as we progress.

2. **Local Development**: Setting up local development for AWS services can be challenging. We may need to use mocks or simplified local alternatives for some components.

3. **TypeScript/Java Integration**: Ensuring consistent data structures between TypeScript and Java components will require careful planning.

4. **AWS Batch Configuration**: Setting up AWS Batch for the report generation job may be complex and time-consuming.

5. **Environment Variable Management**: Managing environment variables across different components and build processes will require careful configuration.

These potential issues will be monitored and addressed as we move into the implementation phase.

## Lessons Learned

As we progress through the project, we will document lessons learned here to inform future work.
