# Project Brief: Experimentation Platform Accelerator

## Overview
This project aims to build a lightweight experimentation platform that enables rapid testing and validation of new features. The platform will provide a framework for data-driven decision making, allowing organizations to quickly test hypotheses and make informed product decisions.

## Project Focus
We will create a simplified but functional experimentation platform that demonstrates the core capabilities needed for effective A/B testing and feature experimentation. This addresses the risk of failing to innovate or respond to evolving technological changes by providing a structured approach to testing and validation.

## Goals
1. Create a simplified experimentation platform that demonstrates the concept
2. Enable quick setup and analysis of A/B tests
3. Provide clear, data-driven insights through reports
4. Implement best practices for cloud-native application development
5. Create a foundation that could be extended for production use

## Constraints
- Project must be completable within one day
- Solution should be focused and demonstrate clear value
- Implementation should follow the rules defined in .clinerules
- Architecture should be scalable and maintainable

## Technical Background
- NX monorepo for project organization with packages in a `packages` directory
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- AWS services for cloud-native implementation
- React for frontend development
- Serverless architecture for backend services

## Key Components
- Unified web interface for experiment management and visualization
- API service for backend operations
- DynamoDB for data storage
- AWS Batch for report generation
- S3 for storing generated reports

## Success Criteria
- Platform enables creation and management of simple A/B tests
- Users can view experiments in action on a sample page
- System collects and stores event data related to experiments
- Reports provide clear insights into experiment performance
- Implementation follows all project rules and best practices
- Code is well-structured and maintainable
