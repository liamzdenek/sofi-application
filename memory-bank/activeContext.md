## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Simplified Architecture**: We've decided to simplify the architecture to make it feasible for a one-day project while still demonstrating the core concept.

2. **Single UI for All Functions**: Rather than separate UIs for different functions, we're using a single unified interface to simplify development and showcase the end-to-end workflow.

3. **DynamoDB for Event Storage**: We're using DynamoDB directly for event storage rather than a more complex event streaming solution to keep the implementation simple.

4. **AWS Batch for Report Generation**: We've chosen AWS Batch for report generation to demonstrate a different AWS service and showcase Java skills alongside TypeScript.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **NX Monorepo Structure**: We have set up the NX monorepo with all packages inside the `packages` directory, ensuring clean separation of concerns while enabling code sharing. The project structure has been fixed to avoid nested directories.

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**: The TypeScript interfaces for API contracts are shared between frontend and backend to ensure type safety.

3. **Environment Variable Management**: We've set up environment variables for both runtime and build-time configuration, with separate configurations for development and production.

4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Following the "no fallback" rule, we've implemented proper error logging and handling throughout the application. Errors are logged and then re-thrown to ensure they're properly handled up the call stack. We've added middleware for request validation and comprehensive logging.

5. **API Robustness**: We've enhanced the API with:
   - Request validation using Joi schemas
   - Environment variable validation
   - Request/response logging
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Detailed API documentation
   - Unit tests for middleware, validation, and routes

6. **AWS Integration**: We've implemented the backend services to work with AWS services like DynamoDB, S3, and AWS Batch, with proper error handling and configuration.

6. **Frontend Architecture**: We've implemented the frontend using TanStack Router for routing and CSS modules for styling. The application is structured with a clear separation of concerns:
   - Layouts: Define the overall structure of the application
   - Pages: Implement specific functionality for each route
   - Components: Reusable UI elements shared across pages

7. **API Client in Shared Package**: We've moved the API client from the experiment-api package to the shared package to allow both frontend and backend to use the same client interface, ensuring type safety and consistency.

### AWS CDK Deployment Implementation

We've successfully implemented and deployed a comprehensive AWS CDK stack that follows the 12-Factor App principles and the implementation rules defined in the project. The deployment architecture includes:

1. **DynamoDB Tables**:
   - Experiments table for storing experiment definitions
   - Events table for storing experiment events
   - Reports table for storing report metadata

2. **S3 Buckets**:
   - Reports bucket for storing generated JSON reports
   - Web bucket for hosting the frontend application

3. **API Gateway and Lambda**:
   - REST API with CORS support and proxy integration
   - Single Lambda function with Express.js for handling all API requests
   - Environment variables for configuration

4. **AWS Batch**:
   - Fargate compute environment with public IP addresses
   - Job queue for processing report generation jobs
   - Job definition for the Java report generator

5. **CloudFront Distribution**:
   - For hosting the frontend application
   - With proper error handling for SPA routing

The deployment process is streamlined using NX commands:
- `npx nx build api` - Builds the API
- `npx nx build web` - Builds the web application
- `npx nx run infrastructure:deploy` - Builds all dependencies and deploys the CDK stack

The application has been successfully deployed with the following endpoints:
- API: https://a9wkrb830e.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/api/
- Web: https://dy6twvdgk8blk.cloudfront.net

Currently, the API is returning "Internal server error" for requests, which needs to be investigated further.

### Open Questions

1. ✅ How should we handle user identification in the sample page for demonstration purposes?
   - We've implemented a fixed user ID and session ID for demonstration purposes in the sample page.

2. ✅ What level of statistical analysis should we include in the report generation job?
   - We've implemented statistical analysis using Apache Commons Math, including:
     - Conversion rate calculations for each variant
     - Improvement percentage calculations compared to control
     - Statistical significance testing using binomial tests
     - Time series data analysis for trends

3. ✅ How should we structure the DynamoDB tables for optimal query performance?
   - We've implemented a structure with appropriate partition and sort keys
   - Added GSIs for querying reports by experimentId

4. ✅ What deployment strategy should we use for the frontend application?
   - We're using AWS S3 and CloudFront for the frontend deployment, configured through the CDK stack.

5. ✅ How should we handle environment variables for the frontend in production?
   - We've set up the frontend to use environment variables at build time, which are injected during the deployment process.

6. ✅ How should we configure AWS Batch for network connectivity?
   - We've configured the Fargate tasks to use public IP addresses by setting `assignPublicIp: 'ENABLED'`
   - Added explicit security group with outbound internet access
   - Granted ECR pull permissions to the task execution role
   - Created new AWS Batch resources with versioned names to avoid update issues
