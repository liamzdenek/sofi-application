# Active Context: Experimentation Platform Accelerator

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the project setup phase and are now implementing the core functionality of the Experimentation Platform Accelerator. The current focus is on:

1. Implementing the backend services for the experimentation platform
2. Setting up the infrastructure for deployment
3. Developing the frontend components
4. Testing and refining the implementation

## Recent Changes

- Created the memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined the simplified architecture for the Experimentation Platform Accelerator
- Established implementation rules and technical constraints
- Defined the API contracts and data flows between components
- Added detailed TypeScript interfaces for all API contracts in api-contracts.md
- Initialized the NX monorepo with all necessary projects and libraries
- Set up basic CDK infrastructure project structure for AWS deployment
- Created the following projects with the correct directory structure:
  - Web application (React): packages/web
  - API application (Express): packages/api
  - Shared library: packages/shared
  - Experiment API library: packages/experiment-api
  - UI Components library: packages/ui-components
  - Infrastructure (CDK): packages/infrastructure
- Fixed configuration paths in jest.config.ts and eslint.config.js
- Removed E2E testing as it wasn't supported on the system
- Implemented shared types in the shared library based on API contracts
- Implemented API client in the experiment-api library
- Implemented backend API services for experiments, events, and reports
- Set up environment variables for local development and AWS deployment
- Implemented comprehensive logging and error handling in the API
- Created shared UI components for experimentation in the ui-components library:
  - Hooks for retrieving experimentation data (useExperiment, useExperimentEvent)
  - Components for displaying experiment variants (ExperimentVariant)
  - Components for tracking experiment events (ExperimentEventTracker)
  - Context provider for experiment data (ExperimentContext)
- Set up environment variable configuration for the experimentation API URL

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Backend Implementation**:
   - Test the API endpoints
   - ✅ Implement error handling and validation
   - ✅ Set up logging

2. **Implement Frontend Components**:
   - Develop the experiment setup UI in the web application
   - Create the sample page for demonstrating experiments
   - Build the report viewing interface
   - ✅ Implement reusable UI components in the ui-components library

3. **Develop Infrastructure**:
   - Complete CDK stack for deploying the application
   - Configure AWS resources (DynamoDB, S3, AWS Batch)
   - Set up environment variables

4. **Test and Refine**:
   - Test the end-to-end workflow
   - Refine the implementation based on testing results
   - Prepare the final demonstration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Simplified Architecture**: We've decided to simplify the architecture to make it feasible for a one-day project while still demonstrating the core concept.

2. **Single UI for All Functions**: Rather than separate UIs for different functions, we're using a single unified interface to simplify development and showcase the end-to-end workflow.

3. **DynamoDB for Event Storage**: We're using DynamoDB directly for event storage rather than a more complex event streaming solution to keep the implementation simple.

4. **AWS Batch for Report Generation**: We've chosen AWS Batch for report generation to demonstrate a different AWS service and showcase Java skills alongside TypeScript.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **NX Monorepo Structure**: We have set up the NX monorepo with all packages inside the `packages` directory, ensuring clean separation of concerns while enabling code sharing. The project structure has been fixed to avoid nested directories.

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**: The TypeScript interfaces for API contracts are shared between frontend and backend to ensure type safety.

3. **Environment Variable Management**: We've set up environment variables for both runtime and build-time configuration, with separate configurations for development and production.

4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Following the "no fallback" rule, we've implemented proper error logging and handling throughout the application.

5. **AWS Integration**: We've implemented the backend services to work with AWS services like DynamoDB, S3, and AWS Batch, with proper error handling and configuration.

### Open Questions

1. How should we handle user identification in the sample page for demonstration purposes?
2. What level of statistical analysis should we include in the report generation job?
3. How should we structure the DynamoDB tables for optimal query performance?
4. What deployment strategy should we use for the frontend application?

These questions will be addressed as we move into the implementation phase of the project.
