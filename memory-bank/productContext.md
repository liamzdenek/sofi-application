## How It Should Work
The Experimentation Platform Accelerator should:

1. Provide a simple interface for creating and managing experiments
2. Allow users to view experiments in action on a sample page
3. Collect event data related to user interactions
4. Generate reports that provide insights into experiment performance
5. Present clear, actionable data to inform decision-making

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Make it easy to set up and analyze experiments
- **Speed**: Reduce the time from idea to insight
- **Clarity**: Present data in a way that's easy to understand
- **Actionability**: Provide clear guidance on next steps based on results
- **Flexibility**: Support different types of experiments and metrics

The platform should demonstrate how SoFi could accelerate innovation by making experimentation a seamless part of their development process, enabling them to respond more quickly to evolving technological changes and customer needs.
